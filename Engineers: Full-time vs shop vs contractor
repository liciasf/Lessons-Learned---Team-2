Pros and cons of hiring engineers from different sources:
1. Full-time
+ Dedication (the engineers have nothing else going on)
+ Cheaper hourly rates
+ Easier to monitor progress
+ Compensation can be in equity
- Takes time, effort and connections to hire good full-time engineers

2. Developer shop e.g. [http://www.thoughtworks.com]
+ Dev shop crew can sit in your office if necessary
+ Teams know how to work together
+ The process is very structured
+ Breadth of skills in dev shop
+ Very fast to hire
- The most expensive option

3. Freelance contractor
+ Easier to find than a full-time employee
+ Doesn't have to be full-time
- If you hire 3 independent contractors they won't know how to work together
- There's no process
