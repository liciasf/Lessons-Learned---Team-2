I learned a lot from the class, i.e. the first two classes gave me a very good first insight into the "world of programming". 
I am not planning to launch my own start up right now or develop a website or app. However, I can imagine that in my job as 
consultant or working in industry I might work on a project where I will need to leverage experts that help me setting up a
website or develop an app. In this context, the class taught me two things: First, it taught me how I can find experts. 
In especially the distinction between hiring someone full time vs. a contractor vs. a shop (incl. advantages, disadvantages 
and related cost helped me a lot. For my own interest, I looked for example at these two programming shops: ThoughtWorks: 
(http://www.thoughtworks.com/) and Pivotal Lab: (http://pivotallabs.com/) Moreover, I know that by looking at communities such 
as GitHub I can obtain a first estimate of quality (e.g., given by number of followers or level and quality of collaboration). 
Second, the class gave me a basic understanding about the language needed to talk to programmers. A lot of the programming 
languages and terms were not familiar to me before and it was very helpful to obtain knowledge about the use of the different 
languages and how I could leverage this knowledge in interviews (e.g., by asking which framework or test a programmer uses).
