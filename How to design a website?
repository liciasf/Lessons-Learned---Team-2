How to design a website?
In order to do that, you need to specify the problem – what do you want the website to do and who will be using it.
-	Talk to people and compare and contrast different websites in the same category and see what key features you want to include. 
-	Same way you build a software – you need to decide on the following:
   o	As a ROLE = Break-down people who will visit your website. For example Visitors, administrators, customers and returning customers. Knowing what each role would be looking for will help customize a website that meets the need of each role.
   o	I want FEATURE = Store Locator, Sorting functionality by price and ratings, Keyword matches that allows for the user to type in a few letters and for a list of predictive words to be generated based what has been typed in the search box, customer service via live chat, email, and phone.
   o	So that BENEFIT = The reason the website visitor would want this feature we want to build.
For example: As a customer who shops on Amazon.com. I want to be able to sort a product im searching for by the year the product was manufactured. The reason I want this feature is because im usually buying products form Amazon at discount and a year of production will allow me to estimate value. 
-	Create a website wireframe, also known as a page schematic or screen blueprint, is a visual guide that represents the skeletal framework of a website.  Wireframes are created for the purpose of arranging elements to best accomplish a particular purpose.
-	You should be doing a request for Quotation (RFQ) for a website design and building of a content management system.
-	It is advised to speak to as many engineers as possible before making a decision of finalizing your website.
