#**Trade offs of hiring locally, regionally and globally**

One of the critical decisions to be made when hiring a software development team is the location of the programmers. 
The optimal solution depends on the context of each project, and should be defined by analyzing each option's
trade-offs, presented below:


###**Local**
-Pros:
  - Better communication - in person interactions offer superior bandwith vs remote interactions
  - Easier to make programmers feel engaged with the project
  - No cultural barrier issues
  - Same schedule for all people involved in the project - no time zone issues

-Cons:
  - Higher costs
  - Specific talent required might not be available locally


###**US/Canada**
-Pros:
  - May have lower costs vs local option
  - Low cultural barriers
  - Still allows for occasional in person interactions
  - Might enable access to critical talent not available locally

-Cons:
  - Limited amount of in person interaction vs. local hiring
  - Cost may still be prohibitive for the project


###**Regional**
-Pros:
  - Lower costs than previous two options
  - Time zone differences are not a very critical issue
  - Sharing of best practices and knowledge from different parts of the world

-Cons:
  - Very limited or no in person interactions
  - Possible cultural barriers
  - May be harder to create engagement with project
  - Requires finding people that are comfortable with and capable of working remotely 


###**Global**
-Pros:
  - Cost
  - Large pool of talent to pull from
  - Time differences may allow for a lower time to market when managed efficiently ("24h shifts")
  - Sharing of best practices and knowledge from different parts of the world

-Cons:
  - Large time zone differences may make communication and interactions difficult
  - Possible cultural barriers
  - Requires finding people that are comfortable with and capable of working remotely
  - Requires additional effort to make programmers feel ownership towards the project.
