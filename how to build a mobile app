I learned that when building out a mobile application, there are three approaches. The quickest and cheapest way is to use PhoneGap/Cordova, which will allow you to create an app using css, java, and html. It will not look native but it is still professional and workable. If we have more to spend in our budget and we are looking to build an app that looks more sophisticated and has a native look but is not a native app, then we should go for the Titanium Appcelerator or Xamarin, which will allow us to deploy native-looking apps on iOS and Android. Finally, if we have the money and capacity then we should go for a native app, which is written in the language of the phone. We would get the best performance by going with a native app but only if we have the resources to go with this approach.
