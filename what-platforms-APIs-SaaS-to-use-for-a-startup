# **Platforms, APIs and Third-party services (SaaS, Cloud hosting)**

There's been a nice overview of the familied of elements of the software world that can be used 
when one is building a new company relying on the IT.
The most useful families of software world are: platforms, APIs and SaaS/third-party-services.

##**Platforms**
I was surprised to know how easy it is to create an e-commerce website for example, so you can just focus on 
you business rather than being concerned about having a decent website with necessary functionality
from the scratch. You may just use the popular platform for creating a e-commerce websites - Shopify. With this platform
you can create a custom website with your brand and products using the pre-written frame code for online stores.
The process of check-out is already built-in and you may stay flexible with your customers regarding payment options.
Shopufy not only allow you to create a decent website for your customers, it also allows you to efficiently run your business.
It has business analytics functionality so you can make your decision based on that. It also allows you to manage incoming orders
from you computer or mobile phone.
More about what is covered by this platform you can learn on [their website](http://www.shopify.com/online)


There are also other types of platforms, like the platform to create blogs, like WordPress or Blogger. 
Valuable platform I learnt about were the PhoneGap and Titanium. Because consumers are switching to
mobile devices it's important to be able to build an app or a mobile friendly website.
PhoneGap allows you to quickly build a decent  app based on the website you have. It's a great solution for
prototyping and testing before commiting to building a native app. Titanium is more advanced
and allows you to workf multiplatform (iOS, android) and write code on Java or C# to build a native-looking app.


##**APIs**
Another family I was surprised to learn is the API. It's an interface that allow different software pieces to "talk to each
other" (like when you can register for a website using your facebook profile, Facebook in this case provide with an API).
It's extremely important nowadays when you want your customers to use their technology efficienly and not providing information
that they have already provided to the other common IT service like facebook, as well as using the most useful features
within your product that are pulled from other common service (like maps, your location, your phonebook etc.)
You can see on the picture below that number of APIs has been growing rapidly

##**Third-party services**
And the last but not the least, is Cloudhosting and SaaS concept when other companies specialize on providing a bulk service 
to other companies that use this service. Like if you want to create a website and you need IT servers to store your 
information you can just use Amazon cloud servers. Or when you want to do a mass email communication you can just use
a ready-made colution by SendGrid or MailGun
